# StudyTrail execution flow

This is the living trace of how the application runs. Update it whenever a
meaningful file, service boundary, or user flow changes.

## Runtime path

```text
Flutter app starts
  -> SupabaseConfig reads compile-time dart defines
  -> Supabase.initialize
  -> StudyTrailApp provides ThemeController and AuthStore
  -> RootFlow checks the current auth session
      -> signed out: Welcome -> Sign up / Log in
      -> signed in with no goal: Upload material -> Set target
      -> signed in with a goal: HomeShell
  -> HomeShell keeps five tabs alive with IndexedStack
      -> Home | Roadmap | Chat | Cards | Profile
```

## Data flow

```text
Screen widget
  -> Provider store (state/)
  -> Repository (data/repositories/)
  -> Supabase Flutter client
  -> Supabase Auth / PostgREST / Storage / RPC
  -> PostgreSQL with row-level security
```

Each signed-in user gets a fresh provider scope keyed by their user id. This
prevents cached study data from one account appearing for another account after
sign-out and sign-in.

## Important user journeys

### Account and onboarding

1. `WelcomeScreen` takes the student to `SignupScreen` or `LoginScreen`.
2. Supabase Auth creates/authenticates the user.
3. `handle_new_user()` creates matching `profiles` and `streaks` rows.
4. `UploadMaterialScreen` uploads a file to the private `materials` bucket or
   records a video link.
5. `SetTargetScreen` creates the active goal and its subjects.
6. `RootFlow` detects an existing goal on later launches and opens the app.

### Daily planning

1. Home loads profile, active goal, streak, today’s tasks, and subjects.
2. Completing a task writes `daily_tasks.done`.
3. The app logs activity and refreshes the streak.
4. Roadmap task changes recompute and persist the goal progress percentage.

### Learning tools

1. Flashcards read decks and cards from Supabase.
2. Grading a card calls the server-side `apply_sr_grade` RPC, which applies
   SM-2 scheduling.
3. Quiz choices are submitted to `finish_quiz_attempt`; correctness and XP are
   calculated on the server.
4. Chat stores the student’s messages now; generated AI answers are a Phase C
   Edge Function responsibility.

## Backend boundaries

- Flutter may use only the Supabase URL and anon/publishable key.
- RLS limits every user-owned row to `auth.uid() = user_id`.
- The `materials` Storage bucket is private and scoped to `/{user-id}/...`.
- Gemini will be called only from Supabase Edge Functions. Its API key never
  enters Flutter, requests, documentation, or version control.

## Current implementation status — 13 August 2026

- Flutter UI and live-data wiring are implemented.
- Supabase schema, RLS, storage policies, seed data, and RPCs are applied.
- The verified flashcard deck-count flow fetches the aggregated `deck_stats`
  view separately, then merges counts into deck rows in Flutter. PostgREST
  cannot embed an aggregated view because it has no foreign-key relationship.
- AI generation, embeddings, material ingestion, and real-time study rooms are
  still pending Edge Functions (Phase C/D).

After every meaningful change, append a dated entry to the **Change log** below
and update the affected path above. Also record any design or technical choice
in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Change log

| Date | Change | Files / area | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-13 | Created the living project-flow document. | Root documentation | Initial flow reconciled with Flutter and Supabase implementation. |
| 2026-08-13 | Fixed flashcard deck statistics query. | `studytrail_flutter/lib/data/repositories/flashcard_repository.dart` | `flutter analyze` and web build succeeded; live deck statistics query returned correct counts. |
| 2026-08-15 | Completed a read-only architecture and security review. | `REVIEW.md` | Confirmed reward-RPC, multi-step write, chat-delivery, and test-coverage risks from source inspection. |
| 2026-08-15 | Added a daily GitHub delivery plan and root repository ignore rules. | `DAILY_PLAN.md`, `.gitignore` | Ready for a clean source-control baseline; local credentials and generated files are excluded. |
| 2026-08-15 | Removed test-account defaults from the backend verification helper before source-control setup. | `supabase/verify_backend.py` | Script now requires supplied test credentials and reads local Supabase defines from an ignored file. |
| 2026-08-15 | Initialised Git and pushed the StudyTrail baseline to GitHub `main`. | Repository root | Commit `aaf625a` is now the shared baseline; future work follows `DAILY_PLAN.md`. |
